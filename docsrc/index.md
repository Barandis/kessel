# Kessel

Kessel is a full-featured parser combinator library written in JavaScript. Its aim is to make it easy to produce robust, arbitrarily complex parsers for any conceivable use.

## Status

Kessel is currently alpha-quality software. The author had no more than a vague notion of parser combinators before embarking upon this project, and while he has learned much about the deep workings of such a library, it's likely that there's more to learn that will result in API changes.

The test suite is considerable (over 600 tests at the time of writing) and code coverage is very nearly or at 100%, but that doesn't guarantee that the software is bug free. If you find a bug or want to request a feature, please use the [GitHub issue tracker][1] for the project.

## Changelog

### Version 0.1.0-alpha, 2020-12-03
* Initial release.
