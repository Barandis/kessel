/**
 * The default formatter for error messages.
 *
 * This function returns a string that has the following parts:
 *
 * 1. A position line that gives the line number and column number where
 *    the error occurred.
 * 2. A visual representation of the error location. This part generates
 *    two lines in the error message. The first is either the entire
 *    input line or, if that's too long, a portion of the input line
 *    started and/or ended with ellipses that contains the error
 *    location. The second is a caret positioned underneath the location
 *    in the first line that shows exactly where the error occurred.
 * 3. The first unexpected error message, if any.
 * 4. All of the expected error messages (if any), separated by 'or' and
 *    commmas as appropriate for the number of messages.
 * 5. The first of the generic messages, if any.
 *
 * The position of the error is indicated by the `index` parameter,
 * which is the index within the array of bytes in `view` where the
 * error occurred. The calculation of line and column number from this
 * flat array of bytes takes the following into account:
 *
 * * Multi-byte characters (everything is UTF-8 aware, so characters can
 *   be 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes long)
 * * Multi-character and single-character multi-byte line endings
 * * Tabs, which are expanded into a number of spaces set by the
 *   `tabSize` parameter
 * * Zero-width characters, such as zero-width spaces and joiners, RTL
 *   or LTR formatting characters, and diacritics (Hebrew or Thai vowel
 *   marks, umlauts over Latin characters, etc.)
 *
 * The output is a single string that contains the 5 elements above.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * The following two lines of code uses `stringToView`, an internal
 * utility function that, as its name suggests, turns a string into a
 * UTF-8 data view. It's called by `parse` itself, so in real world
 * usage, it's not necessary to know.
 *
 * ```
 * const view = stringToView('\tOnomatopoeia\t\t\t\tคำเลียนเสียง')
 * const message = format([expected('a digit')], 29, view, 4, 72)
 * ```
 *
 * From this call to `format`, the following multi-line string will be
 * produced:
 *
 * ```
 * Parse error at (line 1, column 37):
 *
 *     Onomatopoeia                คำเลียนเสียง
 *                                     ^
