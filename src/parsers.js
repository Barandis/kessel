// Here are the string and regular expression parsers which form the
// basis of the entire system.
//
// Every recognizer is a specialization of the StringParser or the
// RegexParser. In other words, these are the only two parsers that
// actually *parse text*. Every other parser either parameterizes one
// of these two to parse something more specific, or they are
// combinators that build more complex parsers. At the end though,
// every combinator calls one of these two, either directly or
// indirectly.
//
// These two are not exposed outside of this file. Their interfaces
// (with the comparison function for the StringParser and the expected
// outcome for the RegexParser) contain things that don't need to be
// exposed. The `string` and `regex` parsers are low-level enough to
// recognize any text, so it's these two parsers that can be composed
// for new parsing functions.
