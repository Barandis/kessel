/**
 * Creates an array of two copies of the provided value.
 *
 * This sort of emulates *as-patterns* in a limited way in JavaScript.
 * In languages like Haskell and ML, when pattern matching is done,
 * there is a construct to be able to retain a larger part of the
 * destructured pattern while also breaking it down further. In Haskell,
 *
 * ```haskell
 * (head : tail) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * ```
 *
 * will assign `1` to `head`, and `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `tail`. This can be
 * done in JavaScript as well, like this:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const [head, ...tail] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * ```
 *
 * However, Haskell can go farther: it can also assign the entire list
 * as a whole to another variable while still assigning its elements as
 * above. It's done like this:
 *
 * ```haskell
 * list @ (head : tail) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * ```
 *
 * This will, in addition to the assignments above, assign `[1, 2, 3, 4,
 * 5]` to `list`. The `@` sign is read *as*, and this construct is
 * called an *as-pattern* (perhaps because the ML way of doing it uses
 * the `as` keyword instead of the `@` symbol).
 *
 * There is no facility to do this in JavaScript. But there are many
 * places in this library where a `Reply` is descturctured into its
 * `Context` and `Result` elements, yet there is a need to conditionally
 * use the entire `Reply` as well (normally to return it if some
 * condition is met). Rather than create a new `Reply` from these parts,
 * `twin` can be used to duplicate the references to the `Reply`. Then
 * only *one* of the duplicate references can be destructured, while the
 * other one is retained as a whole.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const [reply, [context, result]] = twin(parser(ctx))
 * ```
 *
 * As-patterns can be used on pieces of a pattern instead of the entire
 * pattern, and `twin` cannot do that. But it serves for what is needed
 * in Kessel.
 *
 * @param {Reply} value A reply that needs to be destructured while
 *     maintaining a reference to the whole.
 * @returns {[Reply, Reply]} An array containing two copies of the
