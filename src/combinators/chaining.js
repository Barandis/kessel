/**
 * Creates a parser which applies the supplied parser. That parser is
 * expected to result in an array of strings, and if it succeeds, that
 * result's elements are joined together into a single string.
 *
 * If the supplied parser fails, the created parser will also fail with
 * the same state.
 *
 * This is a slightly optimized version of `map(p, x => x.join(''))`. It
 * is useful because JavaScript strings are not lists of characters as
 * they are in some languages, so if a `many` parser (for instance)
 * results in an array of single-character strings, a separate mechanism
 * is necessary to turn them into a single string. This parser provides
 * that mechanism.
 *
 * If the supplied parser does not result in an array, an exception will
 * be thrown because an attempt will be made to call `join` on the
 * result. If it results in an array of something other than strings,
 * those elements will be coerced into strings and then joined.
 *
 * @param {Parser} p A parser that is expected to result in an array of
 *     strings.
 * @returns {Parser} A parser that applies its contained parser and
 *     results in a single string made from joining the elements of the
 *     array of strings.
