# Summary

## Terminology

A couple notes on terms you'll find in this API documentation.

### Parser

Everything in the Parser API Reference is referred to as a *parser*. This is not exactly accurate; in Kessel, a parser is a function that takes a context as an argument and returns a tuple of an updated context and a result. By that definition, the only parsers in here are things like [`any`](parsers/any.md) and [`letter`](parsers/letter.md) that don't take any additional parameters.

A number of items in the reference are functions that *produce* parsers. Examples are [`char`](parsers/char.md) and [`string`](parsers/string.md). These require extra information to know what to parse - `char` needs to know *which* character it's looking for, for example - so they have parameters to let them accept that information. But these functions *return* parsers. In other words, `char` is not a parser, but `char('a')` is. Because of that, it's safe enough to refer to these functions as parsers as well.

The final class of object in the Parser API Reference is the *combinator*. A combinator is a function that takes one or more parsers as parameters, maybe with other parameters as well, and return another parser. ([`block`](/parsers/block.md) and [`blockB`](parsers/blockb.md) take generator functions instead of parsers, but since those generator functions can call parsers in their bodies, they can also be considered combinators.)

Combinators are a little different because they don't actually read text. Every parser or parser-producing function, at the core, is a function that reads one or more characters of text and either succeeds or fails depending on whether it read the character(s) it was expecting. Combinators don't do that; they modify or compose other parsers. For example, [`many`](parsers/many.md) doesn't read any text at all, but it tells the parser passed into it to read text zero or more times.

But in the end it's all the same. `many` may not parse text directly, but it has a value passed to it which may be a parser itself. If it's not, then it must be a combinator that has a value passed to *it*. Eventually, there's going to be a parser, and it will read text. So `many` may not be a parser, and the same with [`choice`](parsers/choice.md) and [`pipe`](parsers/pipe.md) and [`join`](parsers/join.md), but `pipe(choice(char('_'), letter), join(many(choice(char('_'), letter, digit))), (first, rest) => first + rest)` is definitely a parser. (One which does a pretty reasonable job of parsing a programming language identifier..md)

In summary, every entry in the Parser API Reference either *is* a function that takes a context and returns a tuple of a context and a result, or it *produces* one. And directly or indirectly, every entry reads text. So unless there needs to be some distinction between these three different kinds of objects, it's safe to just call them all *parsers*.

### Return

As has already been stated way more times than is necessary, a parser returns a tuple of a context and a result. But as is also very clear, that's way too many words to use too many times.

In this documentation, we will talk about parsers *returning* values. In this case, "this parser returns a string" means "this parser returns a tuple of a context and a result, and upon success, the value of that result is a string." I think we can all agree that one is more fun to read (and write) than the other.
