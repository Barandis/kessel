> `run(p: Parser<T>, input: Input): T`

Executes a parser against input text.

This is a convenience variation of [`parse`](parse.md). Like `parse`, it can accept strings, `ArrayBuffer`s, `DataView`s, and typed arrays as input.

If `p` succeeds, its result is returned directly from `run`, rather than returning a [`Reply`](../types/reply.md) object or a `Result`(../types/result.md) from which it has to be extraced. If the parse fails, `run` will throw an error with the message generated by Kessel's error system.

#### Parameters

* `p` The parser to execute.
* `input` The text to execute `p` against.

#### Returns

* Returns the parsed result.

#### Throws

* Throws an error if any parser within `p` throws an error.
* Throws an error if `p` fails, containing the full error message detailing that failure.

#### See Also

* [`parse`](parse.md)
