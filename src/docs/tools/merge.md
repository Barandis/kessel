> `merge(errors1: ErrorList, errors2: ErrorList): ErrorList`

Merges two error lists into a single error list.

This currently simply concatenates the lists; it does not remove any member of either list. The error formatter itself is regarded as responsible for displaying only the errors in question, so `merge` retains them all.

#### Parameters

* `errors1` The first error list to merge.
* `errors2` The second error list to merge.

#### Returns

* Returns both lists concatenated into a new list.
