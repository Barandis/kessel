> `char(c)`

Parses the character `c`.

There is no character type in JavaScript, as a "character" is just a string with a length of 1. However, using `char` is a bit more efficient than using `string` and should be used as long as only one character is needed.

#### Example

```javascript
const parser = char('a')

const s = parse(parser, 'abc')
console.log(status(s))  // Symbol(ok)
console.log(success(s)) // "a"

const f = parse(parser, 'ABC')
console.log(status(f))  // Symbol(error)
console.log(failure(f)) // Parse error at (line 1, column 1):
                        //
                        // ABC
                        // ^
                        // Expected 'a'
```

#### Parameters

* `c` The character that the next input character must be in order to succeed.

#### Success 

* Succeeds if the next input character is `c`. Consumes and returns that character.

#### Failure 

* Fails if the next input character is any other character, including the opposite case version of `c`.

#### Throws

* Throws an error if `c` is not a string or if it isn't exactly one character in length.
