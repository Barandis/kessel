> `pipeB(...ps, fn)`

Applies some parsers in order, then returns the result of a function to which all of the parser results have been passed.

`fn` will be passed one argument for every member of `ps`. JavaScript does not enforce that there has to be a parameter for each passed argument, but likely you will want to provide an `fn` that has an arity equal to the number of parsers in `ps`.

If any of the parsers fail, then backtracking will return the state to where it was before the first parser was applied.

`fn` can return anything, so this is one of the few combinators that can return something other than a string.

#### Example

```javascript
const parser = pipeB(upper, lower, (a, b) => a.toLowerCase() + b.toUpperCase())

const s = parse(parser, 'Abc')
console.log(status(s))  // Symbol(ok)
console.log(success(s)) // "aB"

const f = parse(parser, 'abc')
console.log(status(f))  // Symbol(fail)
console.log(failure(f)) // Parse error at (line 1, column 1):
                        //
                        // abc
                        // ^
                        // Expected an uppercase letter

const t = parse(parser, 'ABC')
console.log(status(t))  // Symbol(fail)
console.log(failure(t)) // Parse error at (line 1, column 1):
                        //
                        // ABC
                        // ^
                        // The parser backtracked after:
                        //
                        //   Parse error at (line 1, column 2):
                        //
                        //   ABC
                        //    ^
                        //   Expected a lowercase letter
```

See [`pipe`](pipe.md) for an explanation of this example. It's identical except for the final case failing fatally there and being backtracked and failing non-fatally here.

#### Parameters

* `...ps` Zero or more parsers, each of which is applied to the input in order.
* `fn` A function which receives the results of all of the parsers in `ps` if they all succeed. Its return value becomes the result of `pipe`.

#### Success

* Succeeds if all of the parsers in `ps` succeed. Returns the result of `fn` when all of the results of `...ps` are passed to it.

#### Failure

* Fails if the any parser in `ps` fails. If any input was consumed, backtracking will occur and an additional error message will be provided that details the circumstances of the backtracking.

#### Fatal Failure

* Fails fatally if any parser in `ps` fails fatally.

#### Throws

* Throws an error if the last argument is not a non-parser function.
* Throws an error if any other argument is not a parser.
