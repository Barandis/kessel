> `repeat(p, n)`

Applies a parser a certain number of times, collecting the results into an array to return.

The parser `p` must succeed the full `n` times for `repeat` to succeed. Any fewer successes results in failure.

As with other combinators that run multiple parsers, it's possible for `repeat` to fail fatally even if the parser that failed did not fail fatally (because, for example, an earlier success consumed some input). There is another version of this parser, [`repeatB`](repeatb.md), that will backtrack and fail non-fatally when this happens.

#### Example

```javascript
const parser = repeat(letter, 3)

const s = parse(parser, 'abc')
console.log(status(s))  // Symbol(ok)
console.log(success(s)) // ["a", "b", "c"]

const f = parse(parser, '123')
console.log(status(f))  // Symbol(error)
console.log(failure(f)) // Parse error at (line 1, column 1):
                        //
                        // 123
                        // ^
                        // Expected a letter

const t = parse(parser, 'ab3')
console.log(status(t))  // Symbol(fatal)
console.log(failure(t)) // Parse error at (line 1, column 3):
                        //
                        // ab3
                        //   ^
                        // Expected a letter
```

#### Parameters

* `p` The parser to apply. Its results are returned in an array.
* `n` The number of times that `p` is applied.

#### Success

* Succeeds if `p` succeeds `n` times. The results are collected into an array and returned.

#### Failure

* Fails if `p` does not succeed at least once.
* Fails if `p` succeeds at least once but not `n` times and if the prior successes of do not consume any input.

#### Fatal Failre

* Fails fatally if `p` fails fatally.
* Fails fatally if `p` does not succeed `n` times and if prior successes consume some input.
