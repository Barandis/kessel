This user's guide is an in-depth introduction to parsing with Kessel. It explains what parsers are and how they work, covers the most common and important combinators, and explains how you can improve your parsers by improving their error messages.

The goal of this guide is to get you to a place where you can write useful, real-world parsers with Kessel. It doesn't cover every feature (see the [API Documentation](../api.md) for that) but concentrates on concepts that can be used over and over whatever features you use and whatever parsers you write.
