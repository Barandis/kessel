The format here is just something that makes reasonable sense. These are not TypeScript types or anything that's actually useful in code. The types are just to make it easy to talk about their interface. Some of the definitions don't, in fact, represent anything that's actually legal. alt , for example, is given this type information: alt(...ps: Parser[], m?: string) . In JavaScript, you can't declare a function parameter after you declare a rest parameter (the one with the ... in front of it). In fact, in code, this function's signature is just alt(...args) . But the code looks for an optional string at the end, so the type that we provide here is useful for discussing how alt works. A best effort is given to give useful types for documentation, but there's no way to make them perfect. Assertions in the library do take care of most of the problem. If a 3-character string gets passed to char , for example, an error will be thrown whether or not the type system can express that. Parsers There are three kinds of entries in these tables: parsers, functions that produce parsers, and combinators. Since each of these either is or produces a parser, they are all referred to as parsers unless there is reason to differentiate. Additionally, parsers are often said to return a value or to have a value as a result . Parsers all return Reply objects, but when return or result is used, it's meant to refer to the value held by the Result object inside that Reply object. It should be unambiguous. Table 1: Single character parsers Parser Description char Parses a single character. ichar Parses a single character, but without case sensitivity. satisfy Parses a single character for which a predicate returns true . range Parses a single character whose code point is between two other characters. any Parses any one character. oneof Parses a single character which is included in a string or an array. noneof Parses a single character which is not in included in a string or an array. digit Parses a single decimal digit ( 0-9 ). hex Parses a single hexadecmial digit ( 0-9 , a-f , or A-F ). octal Parses a single octal digit ( 0-7 ). letter Parses a single ASCII letter ( a-z or A-Z ). alpha Parses a single ASCII alphanumeric character ( 0-9 , a-z , or A-Z ). lower Parses a single ASCII lowercase letter ( a-z ). upper Parses a single ASCII uppercase letter ( A-Z ). uletter Parses a single UTF-8 letter. ualpha Parses a single UTF-8 alphanumeric character. ulower Parses a single UTF-8 lowercase letter. uupper Parses a single UTF-8 uppercase letter. Table 2: String (multiple-character) parsers Parser Description str Parses a string. istr Parses a string, but without case sensitivity. regex Parses a string matching a regular expression pattern. all Parses the remainder of the input as a string. anystr Parses a string of a certain number of characters. Table 3: Whitespace parsers Parser Description newline Parses a single ASCII newline character ( \\r , \\n , or \\r\\n ). space Parses a single ASCII whitespace character ( , \\t , or a newline). spaces Skips zero or more ASCII whitespace characters. spaces1 Skips one or more ASCII whitespace characters. unewline Parses a single UTF-8 newline character. uspace Parses a single UTF-8 whitespace character (including newlines.md). uspaces Skips zero or more UTF-8 whitespace characters. uspaces1 Skips one or more UTF-8 whitespace characters. eof Succeeds only at the end of the input.

The generator can yield parsers, whose results will be returned as the result of the yield expressions. Returns the result of the generator. many Executes a parser zero or more times until it fails, returning all of the results in an array. many1 Executes a parser one or more times until it fails, returning all of the results in an array. skip Executes a parser and discards the result. sepby Executes a content parser zero or more times with an application of a separator parser between each. Returns the content parser results. sepby1 Executes a content parser one or more times with an application of a separator parser between each.

Returns the content parser results. endby1 Executes a content parser one or more times with an application of a separator parser between each and optionally at the end. Returns the content parser results. repeat Executes a parser a certain number of times, returning the results in an array. pipe Executes a series of parsers in order, then passes the results as arguments to a function, then returns the result of that function. between Executes a content parser between two other parsers, returning only the content parser's result. until Executes a content parser zero or more times until an end parser succeeds. Returns the content parser's results. lassoc Executes a content parser zero or more times with an application of an operator parser between each. Returns the value obtained by left associative application of all functions returned by the operator parser to the results returned by the content parser. lassoc1 Executes a content parser one or more times with an application of an operator parser between each. Returns the value obtained by left associative application of all functions returned by the operator parser to the results returned by the content parser. rassoc Executes a content parser zero or more times with an application of an operator parser between each. Returns the value obtained by right associative application of all functions returned by the operator parser to the results returned by the content parser. rassoc1 Executes a content parser one or more times with an application of an operator parser between each. Returns the value obtained by right associative application of all functions returned by the operator parser to the results returned by the content parser. Table 6: Alternative and conditional combinators Parser Description alt Executes a series of parsers one at a time until one succeeds. opt Executes a parser and returns its result on success. On failure, succeeds but returns nothing. def Executes a parser and returns either its result upon success or a default value upon failure. peek Executes a parser and returns its result without consuming input. empty Executes a parser and fails if the parser succeeds but consumes input. not Executes a parser and succeeds without consuming input if that parser fails. Table 7: Backtracking combinators Parser Description attempt Executes a parser, backtracking to its original position if the parser fails and consumes input. bseq Executes a series of parsers in order, returning their results in an array. Backtracks to where the first parser was applied if any other of its parsers fails. bblock Runs a generator function. The generator can yield parsers, whose results will be returned as the result of the yield expressions. Returns the result of the generator. Backtracks to where the first yielded parser was applied if any later parser fails. bchain Executes a parser, then applies a function to the result, then applies the parser returned by the function. Backtracks to where the first parser was applied if the parser returned by the function fails. bapply Parses content and a function, returning the result of the function when passed the content. Backtracks to where the first parser was applied if the second parser fails. bleft Executes two parsers in order and returns the result of the first one. Backtracks to the location where the first parser was applied if the second one fails. bright Executes two parsers in order and returns the result of the second one.

Backtracks to where the first parser was applied if any other parser fails. buntil Executes a content parser zero or more times until an end parser succeeds. Returns the content parser's results. Backtracks to where the content parser was first applied if it fails before the end parser succeeds. bbetween Executes a content parser between two other parsers, returning only the content parser's result. Backtracks to where the first parser was applied if either other parser fails. Table 8: Chaining combinators Parser Description chain Applies a parser, then applies a function to the result, then applies the parser returned by the function. map Applies a parser, then applies a function to the result, then returns the result of that function. apply Parses content and a function, returning the result of the function when passed the content. value Executes a parser and returns a value. nth Executes a parser and returns the nth element of the resulting array. first Executes a parser and returns the first element of the resulting array. second Executes a parser and returns the second element of the resulting array. third Executes a parser and returns the third element of the resulting array. fourth Executes a parser and returns the fourth element of the resulting array. fifth Executes a parser and returns the fifth element of the resulting array. join Executes a parser and returns its resulting array elements joined together into a string. compact Executes a parser and returns its resulting array minus any null or undefined elements. Tools Tools provide ways to run parsers and ways to write new parsers (if block isn't good enough). Regular users will use the functions in Table 10, but those in Tables 11 and 12 are going to be of interest only to parser authors. Table 9: Running parsers Function Description parse Executes a parser. succeeded Determines whether a parser result was successful. status Returns the status of a parser result. success Returns the value from a parser result if it was successful. failure Returns the error message from a parser result if it failed. run Executes a parser and either returns a successful result or throws an error. Table 10: Error generation Function Description expected Creates an error list containing a single expected error message. unexpected Creates an error list containing a single unexpected error message. generic Creates an error list containing a single generic error message. nested Adds a nested error to an error list. compound Adds a compound error to an error list. other Creates an error list containing a single other error message. merge Merges two error lists. formatErrors Generates an error message out of a parser context and result. getPosition Determines the line/column position of a given context. Table 11: Authoring parsers Function Description parser Creates a new parser. okReply Generates a reply representing a success. failReply Generates a reply representing a failure. fatalReply Generates a reply representing a fatal failure. Types Kessel is written in JavaScript, which is a dynamically typed language, and so none of these types actually exist within the code. However, there is a lot of consistency around what functions expect from parameters and what they provide as return values, and we are able to document that here. For TypeScript users, there will be a declaration file provided which will codify all of these types. Table 13: Types Type Description CompoundError A nested error that happened at a different location than the current context and has its own error message. Context The parsing context, which changes as more of the input is parsed. ErrorList A list of parsing errors. ErrorType The type of a parsing error, used to determine how it should be displayed in an error message. Formatter A function that formats error information into a string. Input Parser input text, which can be in one of several different forms. LocalError A simple parsing error. NestedError An error that happened at a different location than the current context. Parser A function which actually performs parsing. Reply The state of a parser after it has performed its parsing, consisting of an updated context and a result. Result The output of a parser, consisting of either a parsed value or a parsing error. Status The condition of a parser result, including whether the parse succeeded or not.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"api/#summary","text":"","title":"Summary"},{"location":"api/#a-note-about-types","text":"Types are given in the descriptions for each of the parsers and functions listed below.

It shares many of the features of these libraries, brought to JavaScript, and includes some others. Full UTF-8 support, including 3- and 4-byte characters that JavaScript doesn't regularly support Detailed error messages and facilities to customize error messages Optimized implementations of combinators to help make up for the relative slowness of parser combinators in general Written in a consistent functional style, which makes it natural to create new parsers that look and work just like the packaged ones Selectable backtracking Ability to write arbitrary functions that contain other parsers and can be used as parsers themselves To illustrate, here's a short parser definition for a CSV parser.

The goal of this guide is to get you to a place where you can write useful, real-world parsers with Kessel. It doesn't cover every feature (see the API Documentation for that) but concentrates on concepts that can be used over and over whatever features you use and whatever parsers you write.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"guide/ch-01/","text":"Most programmers probably have a good intuitive idea of what a parser is: it's some code that reads a piece of a longer string of text. By that reckoning, this might be the world's simplest parser: const parser = text => { const [ char , ... rest ] = text return [ char , rest ] } This simple little function strips the first character off the text and returns it along with the rest of the unparsed text (which can then have the parser called on it again). It matches any character, so it's like Kessel's any parser. This example parser doesn't handle parsing errors (what happens when text is the empty string?) and is pretty simplistic with what it can work with, but it shares a surprising amount with a Kessel parser. The TypeScript type of the example parser is (text: string) => [string, string] . It takes a string and returns a tuple of two strings, one for the parsed character and one for the remaining text. !!! note \"Tuples\" JavaScript, of course, doesn't have tuples. However, its arrays act very much like tuples in that, unlike most other languages, they can have elements of different types. We consistently use the term tuple when using arrays like this. The TypeScript type of a Kessel parser is very similar: Parser<T> = (ctx: Context) => [Context, Result<T>] A parser in Kessel is a function which takes a context as an argument. It returns an updated context, along with a result. These types are just enhanced versions of what is in the simple parser; a context is just the input text along with information about the current parsing location within that text, and a result is either the parsed value (if the parser was successful) or error information (if it was not). !!! note \"TypeScript types\" Kessel is written in JavaScript, and its author regards TypeScript as a solution looking for a problem. However, one of the purposes of a type system is to create a common language, and we use that here to talk about parameters and return types. If you're not coding in TypeScript, you can safely regard types as nothing more than documentation. Basic parsers Many of the parsers that Kessel come ready to go without any additional information needed. A good example of this is letter . letter is a function that attempts to match a character in the range 'a'-'z' or 'A'-'Z' in the current location in the context passed into it. If it does, the parser is successful; the returned tuple will have a context updated to show which is the next character to parse, along with a result that has the parsed character as its value. There are a few of these basic parsers that match certain classes of characters, like digits, whitespace, and different cases of letters. And of course there's any , which like our simple little example above, parses any character at all. Parser functions The letter parser is ready to use right out of the box; it has all of the information that it needs to do its job. But most parsers need a little extra to get started. For instance, char is a parser that parses only a particular character, but it doesn't automatically know which character, so we have to have a way to tell it. That's done with parameters, and in the case of char , it's just a single parameter that is the character the parser should be trying to parse. char('a') will try to match the letter 'a' , while char('\u042f') will match a Russian capital letter \"Ya\". In this guide we refer to char as a parser function . Wait a minute... A couple paragraphs back, we said \" char is a parser...\", but then we said that char takes a character as an argument. But we've also said that parsers take contexts as arguments, not characters. So what gives? Technically, char isn't a parser at all. It's a function that returns a parser (hence calling it a parser function ). Therefore, while char may not be a parser, char('a') is, and char('\u042f') is a different parser. We don't ever use char by itself; we always use it with an argument. This is the same as saying that we never use the parser function by itself; we instead always use parsers it returns. So unless there's good reason to get into the technical aspect, it's pretty safe just to call them all parsers . Combinators Finally, there is a class of parser functions that take other parsers for their arguments. These parsers are called combinators and hold a special place in a library like Kessel because they can do things that no regular parser can do. They deserve several chapters of discussion, and we'll do just that starting in Chapter 4 .","title":"1.

A parser isn't worth much if you don't give it some text to parse, and we haven't seen how to do that yet. Let's fix that. Kessel offers up the function run to run a parser against input text. It handles creating the context which is then passed to the parser that's being run. We'll talk about that context in a bit, but first let's make a parser just run. I will be doing this in a Node.js REPL. Enter node into a terminal and it should greet you with a message similar to this (the version number may, of course, be different). Welcome to Node.js v14.13.0. Type \".help\" for more information. > The only setup we need is to make sure Kessel is loaded. Locate kessel.js and include it in a require expression. (As I write this, I'm working in a local copy of the repo itself, so it's at ./lib/kessel.js for me; change that part in the command below to match where it is for you.) > let K = require('./lib/kessel') undefined And we're ready to go. This is the way I'm running every example in this user's guide and in the tutorial. There are lots of different ways to run JavScripot code and you can run it any way you want...load it into a browser via a local webpage, write and execute scripts, however you like. Running a parser Let's run a simple parser. > K.run(K.letter, 'abcdef') 'a' run executes the letter parser against the input, and letter matches the first character, which run returns. Namespaces Since we assigned the require expression to the variable K , all of Kessel's parsers and functions are available as properties on K . This might be convenient in code so that you can easily differentiate which parsers came from Kessel and which are custom. Another good way to do it is by destructuring the require expression: const { run, letter } = require('./lib/kessel') Then you could call the parsers and functions without the K prefix. > run(letter, 'abcdef') 'a' This is the way I normally write JavaScript code. However, when working in a REPL as we are here, it's not very convenient to have to know exactly which library functions you're going to use at the very beginning, so we import them all into K and use them from there. What if the parser fails? > K.run(K.letter, '123456') Uncaught Error: Parse error at (line 1, column 1): 123456 ^ Expected a letter A short stack trace follows that, but that's not as interesting as the error message. That message gives the line and column number where the error happened, prints out the line and points to the location, and says what was expected. In a short example, this information isn't that helpful, but if you're parsing a thousand-line document that uses 500 different parsers, you'll appreciate the detail of the error messages. ... Parsing a parser? So after all of the talk in Chapter 1 about contexts , we come over here and see no hint of a context at all when we're running our first parser. Well, that is the way of things. Contexts are handled transparently. run creates the context out of the input text you give to it, and even when we get to composite parsers, we'll see that the context gets passed from parser to parser without us ever even having to see it. You can write an extraordinarily complex parser with Kessel and never even have to know that contexts exist. But run isn't the only game in town. In fact, run is pretty quick and dirty, either returning a successful result or just bailing with an exception. Oftentimes we would like more control than that. That's where parse comes in. parse does everything almost the same as run . It accepts the same arguments (a parser and some input text), it creates the context in the background, it executes the parser against that context. The difference is in what it returns. > K.parse(K.letter, 'abcdef') [ { view: DataView { byteLength: 6, byteOffset: 0, buffer: [ArrayBuffer] }, index: 1 }, { status: 'ok', value: 'a' } ] Alright, so that's a little more involved than the 'a' that run returned.

Let's go ahead now and discuss what those actually are . The context object Here's the isolated context object from the successful parse result above. { view: DataView { byteLength: 6, byteOffset: 0, buffer: [ArrayBuffer] }, index: 1 } Alright, that's fine, but the context is supposed to contain the input text itself. But where's the text? To answer that question, we're going to have to learn (just a little) about character encodings. The most common way to represent characters in the modern age is an encoding called UTF-8. In this encoding, each character is one to four bytes long; the one-byte characters happen to have the same encodings as ASCII characters. This made UTF-8 popular, especially in the West: ASCII is already a subset of UTF-8, and with the multi-byte characters there's plenty of room to cover all of the other languages of the world (with plenty of room left over for emojis). JavaScript comes from a time before UTF-8, and it represents its characters in a two-or-four-byte encoding. 1 The merits of an encoding like this aren't in question; in some ways they're even better because the less-variable length makes it easier to do some things internally within the language. But this encoding causes us some problems. In parsing, it's really important to have a solid concept of \"character\", and these four-byte characters are counted as two characters in most JavaScript operations. (For example, '\ud83c\udf54'.length === 2 is true even though the hamburger emoji is only one character.) Alright, so what does this have to do with context? Basically, since there are some pitfalls to JavaScript string encoding, Kessel has to put in some safeguards, and since it already has to bother with encoding to that degree, it just chucks it all and uses UTF-8 encoding instead. That means it can't use JavaScript strings internally, so instead it uses arrays of UTF-8 encoded bytes . When the context is created, the input text is converted into a UTF-8 byte array. That array is tucked away in the context object within a DataView , which is simply an object that makes it easier to access the byte array. You can see it if you look really close at that example context object again: { view: DataView { byteLength: 6, byteOffset: 0, buffer: [ArrayBuffer] }, index: 1 } There it is, it's the buffer property view property in the context. An ArrayBuffer object is a byte array, and this one happens to hold UTF-8 encoded bytes. Let's look a little closer, since this view doesn't show us much about it. > const [ctx1, res1] = K.parse(K.letter, 'abcdef') undefined > ctx1.view.buffer ArrayBuffer { [Uint8Contents]: <61 62 63 64 65 66>, byteLength: 6 } There's the text! The contents of the array buffer are six numbers, which just happen to be (in hexadecimal) the UTF-8 code points for the letters 'abcdef' . Mystery solved. 2 3 As for the rest of the context \u2014 well, there's just the index . It just points at the byte that is the next to be read when the next parser is applied. The byte array itself doesn't change once the context is created, so rather than stripping bytes off the front (as in the simple example at the start of Chapter 1 ), this index is simply updated. As a final note about context, let's see what happens to index in a parse failure. > K.parse(K.letter, '123456') [ { view: DataView { byteLength: 6, byteOffset: 0, buffer: [ArrayBuffer] }, index: 0 }, { status: 'fail', errors: [ [Object] ] } ] This time index does not move. When letter fails, it does not consume any input, so the next parse attempt will happen at the same place. index reflects this by remaining at 0 when letter fails. This happens with every parser in Kessel that is not a combinator \u2014 they are atomic, so when they fail, it's as though they never ran in the first place. 4 The result object Alright, that was the hard part. Results are easy. Let's isolate the result object of the passing letter parse from the top of this page: { status: 'ok', value: 'a' } Doesn't get much more straightforward than that. The status is 'ok' , which means that nothing failed. The value is 'a' , and it's not coincidental that it's the same as the return value of the successful run invocation from the last chapter . And that's all there is to it. So how does the failed case look? { status: 'fail', errors: [ [Object] ] } This time, the status again tells us how it all worked out, in this case that the parse failed. With failure, there is no value property; in its place is errors , which is an array of objects describing errors that happened in the parse (there can be more than one, but there was not in this case.) Here's a closer look at the object in that errors property. > const [ctx2, res2] = K.parse(K.letter, '123456') undefined > res2.errors[0] { type: 'expected', label: 'a letter' } Each of the errors is just an object with a type and a label . These are used for making nice error messages. There are other types of errors that have different properties than this, but that's something we'll look at later in the guide. Why parse ? Alright, so we've learned a lot about what goes on in the parser internals, but where does that get us in real life? Why wouldn't we just use run and not have to worry about all of these details? Fact is, you may find that run is indeed best for you. But there are certainly reasons to use parse instead. You don't want an exception thrown on failure. You want to write your own error message formatter. Your parser is embedded within other code that will check for the parser's success or failure and act accordingly. You want the added detail for any number of other reasons. If one of these reasons compels you to use parse , rest assured that there are some helper functions to let you avoid getting deep into the internals of a parser reply. Each of these functions takes the reply object that is returned by parse and picks out some part of it to return to you. success returns the same thing as run does, except that it returns null on failure rather than throwing an exception. failure does the opposite; it returns an error message on failure and returns null on success (again, no exception is thrown). succeeded returns true if the parse was successful and false if it was not. status returns 'ok' , 'fail' , or 'fatal' to tell how the parse went. (We'll talk about 'fatal' later in the guide.) Finally, there is formatErrors . This takes a failed reply and returns a detailed error message; it's the same error message that both run and failure use. Using formatErrors grants you access to more options, including the ability to send a custom formatting function in case you want something different out of the error messages. (See Formatter for information about what that function has to look like.) So that's a pretty deep dive into parser internals, but at this point we've done nothing more than parse a single letter off the front of a string. Let's face it, that's not very useful. In the next chapter, we'll start to address that. JavaScript implementations can choose their encoding, as long as how it acts conforms to the spec. And that spec mandates something that is a weird amalgam of UCS-2 and UTF-16; it's not quite UCS-2 because it has four-byte characters through pairs of two-byte code points called surrogate pairs , but it isn't quite UTF-16 because it allows partial and reversed surrogate pairs. \u21a9 JavaScript would encode this same string as <61 00 62 00 63 00 64 00 65 00 66 00> . \u21a9 To show how UTF-8 works, here's the same sort of thing, except using the first six letters of the Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet: > const [ctxr, resr] = K.parse(K.letter, '\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435') undefined > ctxr.view.buffer ArrayBuffer { [Uint8Contents]: <d0 b0 d0 b1 d0 b2 d0 b3 d0 b4 d0 b5>, byteLength: 12 } Twelve bytes to represent six characters; in UTF-8, Russian letters are two bytes long. A JavaScript string with the same content would be encoded <30 04 31 04 32 04 33 04 34 04 35 04> . Even though these particular characters are the same length in both encodings, the encoding values are entirely different. \u21a9 Alright, one more thing about index : it is a byte index, not a character index. Let's see how it works in that Russian text again (this uses uletter because letter only succeeds with ASCII letters). > K.parse(K.uletter, '\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435') [ { view: DataView { byteLength: 12, byteOffset: 0, buffer: [ArrayBuffer] }, index: 2 }, { status: 'ok', value: '\u0430' } ] This time index is incremented by 2, because Russian letters are two bytes long. \u21a9","title":"3.

Basically, since there are some pitfalls to JavaScript string encoding, Kessel has to put in some safeguards, and since it already has to bother with encoding to that degree, it just chucks it all and uses UTF-8 encoding instead. That means it can't use JavaScript strings internally, so instead it uses arrays of UTF-8 encoded bytes . When the context is created, the input text is converted into a UTF-8 byte array. That array is tucked away in the context object within a DataView , which is simply an object that makes it easier to access the byte array. You can see it if you look really close at that example context object again: { view: DataView { byteLength: 6, byteOffset: 0, buffer: [ArrayBuffer] }, index: 1 } There it is, it's the buffer property view property in the context. An ArrayBuffer object is a byte array, and this one happens to hold UTF-8 encoded bytes. Let's look a little closer, since this view doesn't show us much about it. > const [ctx1, res1] = K.parse(K.letter, 'abcdef') undefined > ctx1.view.buffer ArrayBuffer { [Uint8Contents]: <61 62 63 64 65 66>, byteLength: 6 } There's the text! The contents of the array buffer are six numbers, which just happen to be (in hexadecimal) the UTF-8 code points for the letters 'abcdef' . Mystery solved. 2 3 As for the rest of the context \u2014 well, there's just the index . It just points at the byte that is the next to be read when the next parser is applied. The byte array itself doesn't change once the context is created, so rather than stripping bytes off the front (as in the simple example at the start of Chapter 1 ), this index is simply updated. As a final note about context, let's see what happens to index in a parse failure. > K.parse(K.letter, '123456') [ { view: DataView { byteLength: 6, byteOffset: 0, buffer: [ArrayBuffer] }, index: 0 }, { status: 'fail', errors: [ [Object] ] } ] This time index does not move. When letter fails, it does not consume any input, so the next parse attempt will happen at the same place. index reflects this by remaining at 0 when letter fails. This happens with every parser in Kessel that is not a combinator \u2014 they are atomic, so when they fail, it's as though they never ran in the first place. 4","title":"The context object"},{"location":"guide/ch-03/#the-result-object","text":"Alright, that was the hard part. Results are easy. Let's isolate the result object of the passing letter parse from the top of this page: { status: 'ok', value: 'a' } Doesn't get much more straightforward than that. The status is 'ok' , which means that nothing failed. The value is 'a' , and it's not coincidental that it's the same as the return value of the successful run invocation from the last chapter . And that's all there is to it. So how does the failed case look? { status: 'fail', errors: [ [Object] ] } This time, the status again tells us how it all worked out, in this case that the parse failed. With failure, there is no value property; in its place is errors , which is an array of objects describing errors that happened in the parse (there can be more than one, but there was not in this case.) Here's a closer look at the object in that errors property. > const [ctx2, res2] = K.parse(K.letter, '123456') undefined > res2.errors[0] { type: 'expected', label: 'a letter' } Each of the errors is just an object with a type and a label . These are used for making nice error messages. There are other types of errors that have different properties than this, but that's something we'll look at later in the guide.","title":"The result object"},{"location":"guide/ch-03/#why-parse","text":"Alright, so we've learned a lot about what goes on in the parser internals, but where does that get us in real life? Why wouldn't we just use run and not have to worry about all of these details? Fact is, you may find that run is indeed best for you. But there are certainly reasons to use parse instead. You don't want an exception thrown on failure. You want to write your own error message formatter. Your parser is embedded within other code that will check for the parser's success or failure and act accordingly. You want the added detail for any number of other reasons. If one of these reasons compels you to use parse , rest assured that there are some helper functions to let you avoid getting deep into the internals of a parser reply. Each of these functions takes the reply object that is returned by parse and picks out some part of it to return to you. success returns the same thing as run does, except that it returns null on failure rather than throwing an exception. failure does the opposite; it returns an error message on failure and returns null on success (again, no exception is thrown). succeeded returns true if the parse was successful and false if it was not. status returns 'ok' , 'fail' , or 'fatal' to tell how the parse went. (We'll talk about 'fatal' later in the guide.) Finally, there is formatErrors . This takes a failed reply and returns a detailed error message; it's the same error message that both run and failure use. Using formatErrors grants you access to more options, including the ability to send a custom formatting function in case you want something different out of the error messages. (See Formatter for information about what that function has to look like.) So that's a pretty deep dive into parser internals, but at this point we've done nothing more than parse a single letter off the front of a string. Let's face it, that's not very useful. In the next chapter, we'll start to address that. JavaScript implementations can choose their encoding, as long as how it acts conforms to the spec. And that spec mandates something that is a weird amalgam of UCS-2 and UTF-16; it's not quite UCS-2 because it has four-byte characters through pairs of two-byte code points called surrogate pairs , but it isn't quite UTF-16 because it allows partial and reversed surrogate pairs. \u21a9 JavaScript would encode this same string as <61 00 62 00 63 00 64 00 65 00 66 00> . \u21a9 To show how UTF-8 works, here's the same sort of thing, except using the first six letters of the Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet: > const [ctxr, resr] = K.parse(K.letter, '\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435') undefined > ctxr.view.buffer ArrayBuffer { [Uint8Contents]: <d0 b0 d0 b1 d0 b2 d0 b3 d0 b4 d0 b5>, byteLength: 12 } Twelve bytes to represent six characters; in UTF-8, Russian letters are two bytes long. A JavaScript string with the same content would be encoded <30 04 31 04 32 04 33 04 34 04 35 04> . Even though these particular characters are the same length in both encodings, the encoding values are entirely different. \u21a9 Alright, one more thing about index : it is a byte index, not a character index. Let's see how it works in that Russian text again (this uses uletter because letter only succeeds with ASCII letters). > K.parse(K.uletter, '\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435') [ { view: DataView { byteLength: 12, byteOffset: 0, buffer: [ArrayBuffer] }, index: 2 }, { status: 'ok', value: '\u0430' } ] This time index is incremented by 2, because Russian letters are two bytes long. \u21a9","title":"Why parse?"},{"location":"guide/ch-04/","text":"","title":"4.

The same caveats also apply; bblock can implement any other parser, but it's best to use a more specific one if it suits.

It corresponds to using do-notation blocks in Haskell (hence the name block ). The generator function can do anything that any function could do. In addition, it can have yield expressions that yield any parser. That parser will be applied at that point, and if it's successful, its result will be fed back into the generator function, able to be used as needed (for example, in const number = yield join(many1(digit())) in the example, the result of the join parser is assigned to the variable number ). When the generator function returns, its return value becomes the value returned by the block parser. If any of the parsers fail when yielded, then block will fail. If any input was consumed before the failure, that failure will be fatal. block can be used to implement pretty much any other combinator. It, in conjunction with any , could be used to implement any other parser in this library. However, if there is a parser that already does what needs to be done, it's sure to be more efficient than just shoving everything into a block . This is most notable with sequences. A block parser that discards a number of parser results and keeps one, returning that result, can very often be implemented as a seq wrapped in nth . This is a fairly common use case. Example const parser = block ( function * () { yield spaces () const sign = yield opt ( alt ( char ( '+' ), char ( '-' ))) const number = yield join ( many1 ( digit ())) yield spaces () const result = parseInt ( number ) * ( sign === '-' ? - 1 : 1 ) return result }) const s = parse ( parser , ' 1729 ' ) console . log ( status ( s )) // \"ok\" console . log ( success ( s )) // 1729 const f = parse ( parser , 'abcd' ) console . log ( status ( f )) // \"fail\" console . log ( failure ( f )) // Parse error at (line 1, column 1): // // abcd // ^ // Expected a digit const t = parse ( parser , '-abcd' ) console . log ( status ( t )) // \"fatal\" console . log ( failure ( t )) // Parse error at (line 1, column 2): // // -abcd // ^ // Expected a digit The first yielded parser here is spaces . This skips zero or more whitespace characters. Its result is discarded as it is not assigned to anything (besides, spaces only returns null so its result isn't useful). The second yielded parser is opt(alt(char('+'), char('-'))) . This will match either a '+' or '-' if it's there, or return null if the next character is neither of those (without opt it would fail, and we don't want that because it's okay for a number to have no sign). This value (either '+' , '-' , or null ) is assigned to the variable sign . The third yielded parser is join(many1(digit())) . This simply matches a series of one or more digit characters ( 0-9 ), returning them as a single string instead of an array of characters (because of join ). This parses a natural number, assigning the result to number . (When combined with sign , this could be a negative number as well, so the two together parse an integer.) The fourth yielded parser skips whitespace at the end, similar to the first parser. After the parsing is done, sign and number are used in a calculation that turns them into an integer of the JavaScript number type. This number is returned at the end, so the block parser in total results in this number. Note that it isn't a string, like most parsers return; block can return anything that its function can return. The first case ( s ) shows success. Whitespace was skipped before and after the number, an optional sign was parsed (which was not present), and then the string '1729' was parsed. The calculation turned this into the number 1729 , which was returned. The second case ( f ) fails because the first character is not a digit. It does not have to be whitespace ( spaces can match zero spaces) and it does not have to be a sign (that parser is optional), but the digit part of the third parser has to be matched. No input was consumed before this failure, so it is not a fatal failure. The third case ( t ) fails because, while the whitespace was ignored and the optional sign was parsed, the third parser fails against the non-digit 'a' . Since input was consumed (the negative sign) before this failure, it is fatal. Parameters g : A generator function that provides the body of the block parser. This generator function can yield parsers, which will have those parsers' results fed back into the function when it's restarted (so that they can be assigned to variables, used in calculations, etc.). The return value of this generator function becomes the result of the block parser. m : The optional expected error message that will take the place of the default error message. Success Succeeds if every parser that is applied in the generator function succeeds. (Not all parsers need be applied; those that are skipped by conditional statements, for instance, will never execute.) Returns the return value of the generator function. Failure Fails if any yielded parser fails before any input is consumed. Fatal Failure Fails fatally if any yielded parser fails fatally. Fails fatally if any yielded parser fails non-fatally after some input was consumed. Throws Throws an error if g is not a generator function. Throws an error if m exists and is not a string.

It corresponds to the bind operation in the Monad type class in Haskell, which is often spelled >>= . It can therefore be used to implement sequencing in a monadic style, contrasting with the applicative style offered by apply . This parser is not expected to see a lot of use since none of the Kessels parsers are implemented in terms of it, but it is available in case someone wants to parse monadically without using block . There is another version of this parser ( bchain ) that will backtrack and fail non-fatally if the parser returned by fn fails non-fatally. Example const parser = chain ( any (), c => char ( c )) const s = parse ( parser , 'aabbcc' ) console . log ( status ( s )) // \"ok\" console . log ( success ( s )) // \"a\" const f = parse ( parser , '' ) console . log ( status ( f )) // \"fail\" console . log ( failure ( f )) // Parse error at (line 1, column 1): // // // ^ // Expected any character // Note: failure occurred at the end of input const t = parse ( parser , 'abc' ) console . log ( status ( t )) // \"fatal\" console . log ( failure ( t )) // Parse error at (line 1, column 2): // // abc // ^ // Expected 'a' In this example, chain first applies any , which returns the next character of the input. fn then returns char(c) , where c is the result of the any application, and this parser is applied. The upshot is that this example of chain succeeds if the next two characters are the same. In the case of f , chain fails fatally. This is because a character was consumed in p 's success, and if a character is consumed before failure, fatal failure is the result.

Take care when doing this, as backtracking can erase important error information. x can be a value of any type, so this becomes one of the small number of combinators that can return results that are not strings or arrays of strings. Example const parser = def ( join ( seq ( letter (), digit ())), 'Z0' ) const s = parse ( parser , 'a1' ) console . log ( status ( s )) // \"ok\" console . log ( success ( s )) // \"a1\" const r = parse ( parser , '12' ) console . log ( status ( r )) // \"ok\" console . log ( success ( r )) // \"Z0\" const t = parse ( parser , 'ab' ) console . log ( status ( t )) // \"fatal\" console . log ( failure ( t )) // Parse error at (line 1, column 2): // // ab // ^ // Expected a digit Parameters p : The parser that gets applied. If it succeeds, its result is returned. x : An arbitrary value that is returned if p fails. m : The optional expected message that will be added if def fails fatally. Success Succeeds unless p fails fatally. If p succeeds, its result is returned. If p fails, x is returned. Fatal Failure Fails fatally if p fails fatally. Throws Throws an error if p is not a parser.

JavaScript does not enforce that there has to be a parameter for each passed argument, but likely you will want to provide an fn that has an arity equal to the number of parsers in ps . There is another version of this parser ( bpipe ) that fails non-fatally and backtracks if the parser that fails does so non-fatally. fn can return anything, so this is one of the few combinators that can return something other than a string. pipe is functionally the same as applicative lift functions in Haskell. A two-parser pipe is the same as liftA2 , a three-parser pipe is the same as liftA3 , etc. A single-parser pipe is therefore the same as map . pipe(p, q, fn) can be regarded as an optimized implementation of either of the following. chain(p, a => chain(q, b => always(fn(a, b)))) // monadic style apply(p, apply(q, always(b => a => fn(a, b)))) // applicative style Example const parser = pipe ( upper (), lower (), ( a , b ) => a . toLowerCase () + b . toUpperCase ()) const s = parse ( parser , 'Abc' ) console . log ( status ( s )) // \"ok\" console . log ( success ( s )) // \"aB\" const f = parse ( parser , 'abc' ) console . log ( status ( f )) // \"fail\" console . log ( failure ( f )) // Parse error at (line 1, column 1): // // abc // ^ // Expected an uppercase letter const t = parse ( parser , 'ABC' ) console . log ( status ( t )) // \"fatal\" console . log ( failure ( t )) // Parse error at (line 1, column 2): // // ABC // ^ // Expected a lowercase letter In this example, the upper and lower parsers are applied, and the results of each are passed to an arity-2 function which lowercases the first argument and uppercases the second.

Parameters ...ps : Zero or more parsers, each of which is applied to the input in order. fn : A function which receives the results of all of the parsers in ps if they all succeed.

Every parser in Kessel complies with this rule, so every parser that they return, directly or indirectly, also complies. In short: this is only something to be concerned about if you are authoring your own parsers. parser has a property attached to it called created . This property is a function that can be used on any object to see if it is, in fact, a parser that was created with this function. For example, passing the any to this function, parser.created(any) , will return true . Parameters p : A function used to create a parser. Returns Returns a parser conforming to the behavior of p .

To that end, this is a tutorial in which we use Kessel to create a parser that actually does something useful. So what should we parse? For the purpose of this tutorial, I was looking for a couple things. First, it had to be the right amount of complexity. There's an example of a CSV parser earlier in the documentation that's five lines long, which wouldn't make for much of a tutorial at all. On the other hand, one could write an entire book on parsing and compiling C (and in fact many such books have been written), and that's a bit much for a tutorial. The second requirement was that there be a clearly defined spec. I want the focus to be on how to write parsers, not on trying to decipher the language before being able to even figure out what parsers to write. With that in mind, I chose to base the tutorial on writing a TOML parser. TOML is a language for writing configuration files, much like JSON or YAML or even XML could be. It has more features than JSON, has a nicer and more consistent syntax than YAML, and...well, anything's better than XML. The fact that it's my favorite configuration language probably played a part in me picking it as well. The application developed in this tutorial will take a TOML file and spit out an equivalent JavaScript object. We'll have to get deep into the details when the writing actually starts, but to start, let's just get a quick look at TOML syntax. A 10,000 foot view of TOML We'll equate TOML structures to JavaScript structures, since after all we'll be turning the former into the latter.

That's the purpose of the nested error; it saves its own copy of the context where the error actually happened so that information can be put into an error message even after backtracking. A compound error has its own error list, which is where the error(s) which caused the backtracking will be. It also has a message which is used as a header to explain the backtracking.

Kessel deals in UTF-8 characters, which may be anywhere between one and four bytes per character, and using an array of bytes to represent the input lets Kessel deal with the variable-length characters in the most flexible manner. The index is a byte-based index (as opposed to the output of error messages, which is character-based). Kessel ensures that, as long as the byte array is properly formed (i.e., that someone didn't pass in bytes that don't actually represent real characters), it will always have index pointing at the first byte of the next character. Contexts should be created using the functions okReply , failReply , and fatalReply because they ensure that no older contexts are overwritten (which can become important in nested and compound errors, which keep multiple contexts).
