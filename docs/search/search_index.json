Parser Everything in the Parser API Reference is referred to as a parser . This is not exactly accurate; in Kessel, a parser is a function that takes a context as an argument and returns a tuple of an updated context and a result. By that definition, the only parsers in here are things like any and letter that don't take any additional parameters. A number of items in the reference are functions that produce parsers. Examples are char and string . These require extra information to know what to parse - char needs to know which character it's looking for, for example - so they have parameters to let them accept that information. But these functions return parsers. In other words, char is not a parser, but char('a') is. Because of that, it's safe enough to refer to these functions as parsers as well. The final class of object in the Parser API Reference is the combinator . A combinator is a function that takes one or more parsers as parameters, maybe with other parameters as well, and return another parser. ( block and blockB take generator functions instead of parsers, but since those generator functions can call parsers in their bodies, they can also be considered combinators.) Combinators are a little different because they don't actually read text. Every parser or parser-producing function, at the core, is a function that reads one or more characters of text and either succeeds or fails depending on whether it read the character(s) it was expecting. Combinators don't do that; they modify or compose other parsers. For example, many doesn't read any text at all, but it tells the parser passed into it to read text zero or more times. But in the end it's all the same. many may not parse text directly, but it has a value passed to it which may be a parser itself. If it's not, then it must be a combinator that has a value passed to it . Eventually, there's going to be a parser, and it will read text. So many may not be a parser, and the same with choice and pipe and join , but pipe(choice(char('_'), letter), join(many(choice(char('_'), letter, digit))), (first, rest) => first + rest) is definitely a parser. (One which does a pretty reasonable job of parsing a programming language identifier..md) In summary, every entry in the Parser API Reference either is a function that takes a context and returns a tuple of a context and a result, or it produces one. And directly or indirectly, every entry reads text. So unless there needs to be some distinction between these three different kinds of objects, it's safe to just call them all parsers . Return As has already been stated way more times than is necessary, a parser returns a tuple of a context and a result. But as is also very clear, that's way too many words to use too many times. In this documentation, we will talk about parsers returning values. In this case, \"this parser returns a string\" means \"this parser returns a tuple of a context and a result, and upon success, the value of that result is a string.\" I think we can all agree that one is more fun to read (and write) than the other. Parsers Table 1: Single character parsers Parser Description char Parses a single character. charI Parses a single character, but without case sensitivity. satisfy Parses a single character for which a predicate returns true . satisfyM Parses a single character for which a predicate returns true .

Table 2: String (multiple-character) parsers Parser Description string Parses a string. stringI Parses a string, but without case sensitivity. regex Parses a string matching a regular expression pattern. all Parses the remainder of the input as a string. anyString Parses a string of a certain number of characters.

It shares many of the features of these libraries, brought to JavaScript, and includes some others. Full UTF-8 support, including 3- and 4-byte characters that JavaScript doesn't regularly support Detailed error messages and facilities to customize error messages Optimized implementations of combinators to help make up for the relative slowness of parser combinators in general Written in a consistent functional style, which makes it natural to create new parsers that look and work just like the packaged ones Selectable backtracking Ability to write arbitrary functions that contain other parsers and can be used as parsers themselves To illustrate, here's a short parser definition for a CSV parser. This is a fully featured parser which can handle quoted commas, escaped quotes, and the like. This example is taken from a similar example in the online book Real World Haskell . It's shorter than the Haskell/Parsec version, but JavaScript's lack of custom operators means it's perhaps a bit more dense.

The generator can yield parsers whose results are returned to the generator when it's restarted. Returns the return value of the generator. block is the most flexible of all of the parsers in the library, able to do anything that can be coded into a function and able to return any value. In the example, a spaces parser is applied first, which skips any leading whitespace ( yield spaces is not assigned to a variable, so the result of the spaces parser is discarded). Next is a choice(char('+'), char('-')) parser, which will match either + or - and assign that character to the variable sign . The third parser to run is join(many1(digit)) , which reads one or more digits, joins them into a string, and assigns that string to the variable number . Finally, another spaces parser is applied and its result discarded. The result of the parser is then calculated by parsing the string number with parseInt to create an integer, which is then multiplied by -1 if the value of sign is - . This is then returned by the last line of the generator function. Note that in the success case, the value that's returned is the number -1729 , not the string '-1729' . The return statement in the generator function returns a number, so that's what the result of the block parser will be. This illustrates that block can do anything that a function can do. If any of these parsers fail, the block parser itself also fails. As shown in the two failure cases, if no input has yet been consumed (as in the f case), the failure is non-fatal. In the second ( t ) failure case, the - is consumed before the digit parser fails to parse the character a , and since something has been consumed, that failure will be fatal. There is another version of this parser, blockB , which will fail non-fatally and backtrack if a yielded parser fails non-fatally. Simpler block s can often be rewritten into sequence parsers. The full power of block is most appropriate when a) calculations need to be done to the results of yielded parsers, b) a non-string result needs to be returned, or c.md) some of the parsers may be working asynchronously.

If a parser in ps succeeds, no further parsers will be applied and the result of the successful parser will be returned. If a parser in ps fails fatally, no further parsers will be applied and choice will fail fatally. This rule is necessary to ensure that each branch of the choice is starting from the same state (a fatal failure generally means input is consumed and the state has therefore changed). If all parsers in ps fail, then choice fails as well. The example shows two success cases. In the first one, the application of the first parser ( left(letter, digit) ) succeeds and its result is returned. In the second one, the application of the first parser fails, but the application of the second one ( right(digit, letter) ) succeeds and its result is returned. In the first failure case, both parsers fail but neither consumes any input, so choice fails non-fatally. In the second case, the first parser fails fatally (it consumes a before it fails on the space), so the second parser is never applied and choice fails fatally. Because choice fails immediately if any of its parsers fails fatally, it is quite common to wrap its parsers in attempt to turn their fatal failures into non-fatal failures.

A character is a Unicode uppercase character if it has the Unicode Uppercase binary property. This is approximately equal to characters that match the regular expression /\\p{Lu}/u except with a few additional characters. A character is a Unicode titlecase character if it has the Unicode Letter, Titlecase property, which is the same as characters that match the regular expression /\\p{Lt}/u . Titlecase characters are typically ligatures of an uppercase character with a lowercase character, such as \u01c8 . (The double-lowercase counterparts such as \u01c9 are considered lowercase letters and would be parsed by lowerU .) Success Succeeds if the next character is a Unicode uppercase or titlecase letter.
